# 🚀 Deployment Improvements - Soft Terminal LLM

## ✅ What We've Accomplished

### 1. **Automatic Boot Startup** 
- Created systemd service (`soft-terminal.service`) that starts automatically on boot
- Service manages both API and UI containers with proper dependencies
- Configured to restart on failure for resilience

### 2. **Professional Service Management**
- `manage.sh` script for easy control:
  - `./manage.sh start/stop/restart` - Control service
  - `./manage.sh health` - Check system health
  - `./manage.sh logs` - View real-time logs
  - `./manage.sh browser` - Launch kiosk mode

### 3. **Log Rotation**
- Configured logrotate to manage conversation logs
- Keeps 30 days of compressed history
- Prevents disk space issues

### 4. **Kiosk Mode Browser**
- `launch-browser.sh` for full-screen child-friendly interface
- Disabled error dialogs and info bars
- Auto-start option for desktop environments

### 5. **Health Monitoring**
- `check-health.sh` script verifies:
  - Service status
  - Container health
  - API/UI endpoints
  - Conversation logging
  - System resources

### 6. **Improved Deployment Process**
- One-command sync from Mac to Pi
- Automatic npm dependency installation
- Environment file management (.env.production)

## 📍 Access Points

- **Web UI**: http://192.168.1.100:3000
- **API**: http://192.168.1.100:8000
- **Logs Viewer**: http://192.168.1.100:8000/logs

## 🎮 Quick Commands

```bash
# On your Mac (development)
./deploy-improved.sh        # Deploy to Pi

# On the Pi
./manage.sh health          # Check everything is working
./manage.sh restart         # Restart services
./manage.sh browser         # Launch kiosk mode
sudo reboot                 # Test boot startup
```

## 🔄 Boot Sequence

When the Pi boots:
1. Network comes online
2. Docker service starts
3. `soft-terminal.service` activates
4. Docker Compose brings up containers
5. API and UI become available
6. (Optional) Desktop auto-launches browser in kiosk mode

## 📊 Current Status

✅ **Service**: Running and enabled for boot
✅ **API**: Responding at port 8000
✅ **UI**: Accessible at port 3000
✅ **Logs**: Recording conversations
✅ **Health**: All systems operational

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

If something goes wrong:

```bash
# Check service status
sudo systemctl status soft-terminal

# View detailed logs
sudo journalctl -u soft-terminal -n 100

# Run health check
./check-health.sh

# Manually restart
sudo systemctl restart soft-terminal

# Check Docker containers
docker ps
docker logs soft-terminal-api
docker logs soft-terminal-ui
```

## 🔐 Security Considerations

- API key stored in `.env` file (not in git)
- Containers run with limited privileges
- Log rotation prevents disk filling
- Rate limiting can be added (see `api/rate_limiter.py`)

## 🚦 Next Steps (Optional)

1. **Add monitoring dashboard** - Grafana for metrics
2. **Implement backup** - Automated SD card backups
3. **Add voice interface** - Web Speech API
4. **Create parent controls** - Admin interface at `/admin`
5. **Multi-user support** - Different profiles for siblings

## 📝 Architecture Decision

We chose to **keep deployment local** rather than cloud hosting because:
- **Privacy**: Children's conversations stay in your home
- **Control**: You decide when/how to update
- **Cost**: No monthly hosting fees
- **Simplicity**: No authentication complexity
- **Reliability**: Works on local network even if internet is slow

## 🎉 Success Metrics

The deployment is successful because:
- ✅ Starts automatically on boot
- ✅ Survives power outages
- ✅ No manual intervention needed
- ✅ Child can use it independently
- ✅ Parents can review conversations
- ✅ System self-manages logs
